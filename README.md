# EMS-mutagenesis-SQL-and-Python
This project deals with the identification of SNPs that rescues the ssadh phenotype of Arabidopsis thaliana. The ssadh homozygous mutant showed abnorml phenotype. EMS mutagenesis of the ssadh seeds induced thousands of random mutations in the genome. The EMS mutation rescues the ssadh phenotype almost to a wild type level. The question is which mutation/s is/are responsible for rescuing the ssadh phenotype. Selected lines named as L7D, L13J, L17J and L21H showed an improved phenotype compared to the ssash homozygous line. QTL analysis using bi-parental crosses (col-0 with Ler ecotypes, ssadh mutant is col-o background) showed that mutations at the lower arms of chromsome 2 and five are resposnsible for suppression of ssadh phenotype. The regions were identified using PCR based markers that distinguish between the two ecotypes (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318793356_The_suppression_of_Arabidopsis_succinic_semialdehyde_dehydrogenase_SSADH_phenotype_by_using_ethyl_methane-sulfonate_mutagenesis_EMS). The genomic DNA from these four lines were extracted and genotyped using NGS. The SNPs in the regions was further charatcterized using SQL and Python codes to select putative mutations. The SQL codes for cleaning and analysis of the data was carried out on google bigquery page.
